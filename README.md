# Thought Catcher

This was a group project to create an application that could be used in conjunction with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), to track thinking patterns and moods.

Thought Catcher is designed to give you a basic understanding of CBT and to give you a place to keep notes on your recent thoughts and moods. 

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://acdmproject.github.io/Thought-catcher/

The Mood Scriber takes you through a step by step process to log your moods and thoughts.

The entries are then visible in the diary page and are graphically represented in the Dashboard. The Dashboard displays your entries from the past week or month.
