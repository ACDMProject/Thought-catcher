      <h3>
        1. The 'Black and White' Mindset
      </h3>
      <h4>
        <div className="img1"><img src="Black-and-White.png" alt="First Mindset"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/> </div>
        You believe in one of the two extremes like failure or success and that there is no ‘grey’ areas.
      </h4>
      <h5>Example: although you passed your driving test, you had two minor faults and you feel like you failed because
        you did pass perfectly.</h5>
    </section>






    <section id="two" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        2. Jumping to Conclusions
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img2"><img src="JumpingToConclusions.png" alt="Second Mindset"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/> </div>
        You make pessimistic interpretations or predictions without any supporting evidence. It’s like having a
        crystal ball that constantly tells you negative readings.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: you’re wearing a shirt that makes you feel uncomfortable and feel like everyone is commenting on it
        behind your back, or you apply for a promotion that you are sure you won’t get.</h5>
    </section>




    <section id="three" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        3. Overgeneralisation
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img1"><img src="Overgeneralisation.png" alt="Third Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You come to a general conclusion based on a specific single incident. This creates an overview that you may
        choose
        to follow.
      </h4>

      <h5> Example: you fail an exam, conclude you’re a failure and decide if you should drop out.</h5>
    </section>

    



    
    <section id="four" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        4. Catastrophisation
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img2"><img src="Catastrophisation.png" alt="Fourth Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You view an unfavourable outcome to an event and then decide that if this outcome does happen, the results
        will be a disaster.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: you feel like you fail when you try something new, so you believe that you will fail at everything
        you try that you don’t have any experience in.</h5>
    </section>




    
    <section id="five" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        5. Mental Filter
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img1"><img src="Mental-Filter.png" alt="Fifth Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You take the negative details and magnify them while also filtering out all positives of a situation.
      </h4>
      <h5> Example: you’re a Youtuber and one of your videos attract loads of positive comments from your fans,
        however, you notice a bad comment and you only focus on that. </h5>

    </section>
   




 
    <section id="six" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        6. Diminishing the Positives
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img2"><img src="Diminishing-the-Positives.png" alt="Sixth Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You disqualify all the positives, coming up with several reasons why the positive events in your life do
        not count.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: you believe you got ‘lucky’ and that is the reason why you got promoted, not because of your
        successes. </h5>

    </section>
    


    
    <section id="seven" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        7. Personalisation
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img1"><img src="Personalisation.png" alt="Seventh Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You believe that everything others say or do is some kind of direct, personal reaction to you. You often
        compare yourself to others and you take things personally even when it was not meant that way.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: you’re having a retirement party and because your brother was late, you feel like this caused
        your guessed to not enjoy it. </h5>

    </section>
    

   
    <section id="eight" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        8. Shoulds
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img2"><img src="Shoulds.png" alt="Eighth Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You follow a bunch of rules about how someone ‘should’ behave, when you break one of these rules you feel
        either angry or guilty that you’ve failed.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: you should eat healthy and that you shouldn’t eat any takeaways. </h5>
    </section>
    



  
    <section id="nine" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        9. Emotional Reasoning
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img1"><img src="Emotional-Reasoning.png" alt="Nineth Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        You feel a certain way and assume that it is true. This may lead to you ignoring rationality and logic
        when you make your assumptions.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: You feel like a failure, so you must be a failure. </h5>
    </section>
    




   
    <section id="ten" className="wrapper-style-2">
      <h3>
        10. Universal Labelling
      </h3>

      <h4>
        <div className="img2"><img src="Universal-Labelling.png" alt="Tenth Mindset" className="center"
            style="width:120px;height:120px;margin-right:15px;"/></div>
        Instead of describing a mistake in context of a particular situation, you assign an unhealthy label on
        yourself or others. This is a mixture of stereotyping and overgeneralisation.
      </h4>

      <h5>Example: you mislabel your colleague as ‘difficult and rude’ when you met him once at a company conference
        without bothering to understand any context around why. </h5>
    </section>


  </div>
